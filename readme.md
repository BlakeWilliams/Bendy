Bendy Framework based off of the Less Framework, available at http://lessframework.com/

# Customizing
Bendy by default assumes that you want to use body as your container. This has its advantages but there are also quite a few reasons why you wouldn't want body to be your container. One of these reasons is full width divs. If you want a full width div, change all 4 instances of body that is underneath a size definition and keep the div that you want to be full width outside of the container.
