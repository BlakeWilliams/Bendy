# Bendy Framework
An awesome simple and tiny framework for making responsive websites that scale from desktop size layouts, down to mobile sized layouts. It includes 3 media queries that all inherit from your default styles. These are tablet, mobile, and wide mobile (also inherits from mobile).

# Usage
Just use the following code to change the SCSS into the proper CSS. Ff you want your code compressed, change expanded to compressed.

    sass --watch scss:. --style expanded
